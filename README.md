# Darrik.dev - My personal site

This is my personal site, hosted on Netlify - built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) & [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/). I share articles and other stuff here. 

The site itself is in the [`site` directory](/site) with some utility functions in the [`utils` directory](/utils). I also have a series of Netlify functions in the [`functions` directory](/functions) for handling Open Graph Images and newsletter signups. 


## Be inspired, but don't plagiarize
This code for this site is open so people can learn from it. But the content is still 100% my own. If I do something you think is cool, feel free to copy that piece of code, but please don't clone the site wholesale and use it as your own. Instead, pick a starter in your favorite SSG and build your own corner of the web.
