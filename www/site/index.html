            My employer started a version of "Shark Tank" where employees
            could pitch ideas directly to IT management. I pitched an idea to
            improve collaboration and communication in the division by using a
            forum to centralize knowledge. Two other people submitted similar
            ideas, so they grouped us together. To help make our presentation
            stand out, I spun up a quick site using{{" "}}
            <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue</a>,{{" "}}
            <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com">Vuetify</a>, &amp; hosted it with{{" "}}
            <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. This site served
            as the slideshow for our presentation and was a big hit among both
            the "Sharks" and the 2 peers I presented with.

            This is my first Gatsby Theme. It was inspired by a twitter
            conversation I had with Sarah Drasner and Jason Lengstorf. It
            creates an accessible soundboard on any site. It allows the sounds
            to trigger side effects (such as lambda functions) when a button
            is pressed.
